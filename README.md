# Joint ML Journal club

## Suggestions for future papers

We would like to see these papers presented in a future meeting of the Joint ML Journal club.
If any of them takes your fancy, please contact us; henry.day-hall@desy.de and tmartinez@hs.uni-hamburg.de.

  1. "Scalable Spatiotemporal Prediction with Bayesian Neural Fields" [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07657](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07657).
  2. "All Random Features Representations are Equivalent", [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.18802](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.18802) (would need a bit more background on kernel methods explained)
  3. "Geometry of the Loss Landscape in Overparameterized Neural Networks: Symmetries and Invariances" [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05800](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05800)
  4. The original Adam paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980 )
